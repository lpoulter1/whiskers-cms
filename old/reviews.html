                <p>Kathy looked after our cat Maisie over the holidays and Maisie loved her! Would
                    definitely recommend!</p>

                <p>Kathy is so kind, friendly and trustworthy. She was happy to come round and meet
                    our
                    cat Happy before we went away over Christmas. She had some great suggestions for
                    Happy like leaving a little hot water bottle for him under his bed and leaving
                    treats around the flat for him to find whilst we were away. She was very easy to
                    communicate with so we were assured that Happy would be well looked after. She
                    also
                    refreshed his litter tray while we were away and was happy to turn lights on and
                    off. Whilst we were away, she kept us updated regularly with texts about how he
                    was!
                    When we returned home, Happy was all snuggled up in his usual spot and came out
                    to
                    see us happily. He is usually a pretty nervous cat around strangers but Kathy
                    said
                    that on one of her visits he came out and ate his dinner whilst she was in the
                    room!! We would definitely recommend Kathy's cat sitting services! Very
                    pleased.</p>

                <p>Kathy walked our dog Ethel while we were on holiday for two weeks and treated her
                    as one of her own. The love she has for dogs of all breeds is easy to see and
                    she also knows how to get them to stick to the rules! Ethel made best mates with
                    Kathy’s dog Tara while we were away and we would have no hesitations to book her
                    again..</p>

                <p>I have been extremely pleased with the Waggles and Whiskers service. Kathy was
                    very
                    friendly and took such good care of my dog ! He seemed tired out and well looked
                    after ! Much better than other dog walking services I have used I will
                    definitely be
                    continuing with waggles and whiskers. Thank You!</p>

                <p>Kathy has been walking my Daschund Colin for the past 18 months. Kathy is
                    fantastic, she is kind and caring and has managed to help Colin overcome his
                    fear of bicycles with her patient approach. I would definitely recommend
                    Kathy.</p>

                <p>Kathy has always taken excellent care of my dog and I know he's always in great
                    hands with her, he's so excited each time he sees her. She has a wonderful
                    approach with him and the group walks means he gets to play and have a great run
                    around. I'd definitely recommend Waggles & Whiskers to anyone with a dog or
                    other pet! A friendly, personal and lovely service.</p>
