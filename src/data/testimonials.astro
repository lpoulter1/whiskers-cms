Kathy also walked our previous dog, we have known her for about five years. Kathy is very reliable and always friendly and smiling, even when she is off out in the pouring rain. I highly recommend Waggles and Whiskers.",

We have used Kathys dog walking service for 4 or 5 years now and have always been very pleased. The service is warm and friendly but also incredibly knowledgeable about a wide variety of breeds. We thoroughly recommend Kathy to everyone we know and to those we don't.",
